Recently, I've faced the problem that you can't <i>put back</i> multiple files at once from Trash in MacOS.

The problem is that MacOS can't restore 2 (or more) files from different directories. WTF?

At first, I was very frustrated because I had ~10000 files in there. Started looking out for a proper solutions & <a target="_blank" href="http://giacomoballi.com/applescript.html">found script</a>, which automates restoring process.

Script often failed, so I tweaked it & here is my version. I hope it could help you ;)
