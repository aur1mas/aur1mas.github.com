    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently, I&#8217;ve faced the problem that you can&#8217;t <i>put back</i> multiple files at once from Trash in MacOS.</p>

<p>The problem is that MacOS can&#8217;t restore 2 (or more) files from different directories. WTF?</p>

<p>At first, I was very frustrated because I had ~10000 files in there. Started looking out for a proper solutions &amp; <a target="_blank" href="http://giacomoballi.com/applescript.html">found script</a>, which automates restoring process.</p>

<p>Script often failed, so I tweaked it &amp; here is my version. I hope it could help you ;)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>Background</h3>


<p>After playing around with <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/" target="_blank">Ruby on Rails</a> it was hard to comeback to PHP frameworks world. A lot of functionality was missing (assets, easy deployment, rake &amp; etc). But most of all I missed <a href="http://gembundler.com/" target="_blank">Bundler system</a>.</p>

<p>But recently I&#8217;ve found <strong><a href="http://www.getcomposer.org" target="_blank">Composer</a></strong>. And started messing around. Installation was very simple. It took me 5-10 min. integrating <a href="http://framework.zend.com" target="_blank">Zend Framework</a> to existing project.</p>

<h3>Problem</h3>


<p>After this I started thinking how to integrate <strong>Composer</strong> into my deployment. I&#8217;m using Capistrano for deployment which is another great gem written in <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/" target="_blank">Ruby</a>. Main problem which I was solving - when deploying project Capsitrano creates new directories from each deployment. So each time Composer installed packages over &amp; over again.</p>

<h3>Solution</h3>


<p>In the end I only had to write few lines of code &amp; put them in deploy.rb file.</p>

<pre><code>before "deploy:restart", "deploy:install"

namespace :deploy do
    desc "run composer install and ensure all dependencies are installed"
    task :install do
        run "ln -s #{deploy_to}vendor #{deploy_to}current/vendor"
        run "cd #{current_path} &amp;&amp; php composer.phar install"
    end
end
</code></pre>

<p>I think code is self explanatory &amp; I don&#8217;t have write what every line does. But if you have any questions - feel free to ask in comments.</p>

<p><strong>P.S.</strong> improve my english :) If you&#8217;ve noticed any mistakes - write in comments. Thanks!</p>
